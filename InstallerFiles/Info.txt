One Way Mirror will mirror all Files and Directories in the Source Directory into those same-named Files and Directories in the Destination Directory.  Only newer files will be copied, and no files or directories will be deleted in the Destination Directory.

Script files are also supported.  These can be used to maintain a list of Source and Destination directories, and the options for sopy files from the Source to the Destination.

The drop-down lists used on One Way Mirror's interface will be maintained between application starts.  In this way,  a list of directories, and Script files, can be easily remembered, and re-used.


One Way Mirror is freeware, and may be distributed freely.
